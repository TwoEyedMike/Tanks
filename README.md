Gameplay:

Use the arrow keys to move the tank, and space to shoot.

You'll encounter 3 powerups throughout the levels:

1. Life Raft - This allows your tank to temporarily cross over water. Don't worry about drowning, the raft will not go away until you're safely back on land.
2. Shield - This temporarily makes you immune to damage.
3. Drill - This temporarily lets you instantly destroy bricks when driving into them.

Some free-to use assets from opengameart.org were used in the making of this game.
